---  

Storm is distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation platform that offers stream processing, continuous computation, distributed RPC, and more.  


<p>
Storm is a <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/free-and-open-source.html">free and open source</a> distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm is <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/simple-api.html">simple</a>, can be used with <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/multi-language.html">any programming language</a>, and is a lot of fun to use!
</p>

<p>
Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over <strong>a million tuples processed per second per node</strong>. It is <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/scalable.html">scalable</a>, <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/fault-tolerant.html">fault-tolerant</a>, <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/guarantees-data-processing.html">guarantees your data will be processed</a>, and is <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/deployment.html">easy to set up and operate</a>.
</p>

<p>
Storm <a href="http://storm-project.net/about/integrates.html">integrates</a> with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed. Read more in <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Tutorial">the tutorial</a>.
